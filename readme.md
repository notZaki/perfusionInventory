An experimental website for displaying software/data related to perfusion MRI [link](https://inventory.notzaki.com/).

## Building the website locally

The pages were generated with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) and [VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/). 

To build the website locally, first download [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).
Then clone this repository and in the repository folder, run `npm install` to download/install the dependencies, followed by `npm run docs:dev` to generate the pages.
